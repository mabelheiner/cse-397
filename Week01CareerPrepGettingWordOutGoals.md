SMART Goals Research: 
Specific - What needs to be accomplished? Who is responsible? What steps are needed?
Measurable - How will this goal be measured? How will progress be tracked over time?
Achievable - Is this something you can accomplish?
Relevant - Why are you setting this goal? How will this help you in the long term?
Time-Bound - When will this goal be finished or evaluated?

Resume Improvements: 
- I need to use better verbs to describe my projects
- I need to post more on LinkedIn
- I need to be more specific in my skills and expertise
  
Job Posting & Evaluation: Find 3-4 jobs that you would like have applied or recommend. Provide links. And why are they good matches. Evaluate them.

Equivalent: what elements of the jobs are equivalent to what you already know? Equivalents could be languages, skills, CASE (computer-aided software environments, i.e., IDEs), tools, or techniques

Improvements: What elements do you think you could find out and learn about? (example could be domain knowledge, software, Third-party packages)

SMART Goals: From the previous task, Job Posting & Evaluation, identify a common thread of Improvements. Include a list of classmates that you looked at. (For example: What are some standard search engines? What makes a good match? What equivalent comparisons of languages, tools, and techniques? What are we missing?)
Create two S.M.A.R.T. goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time), one based on what you learned from your fellow classmates, and one from job search.
